# connect-social-media

MERN social media project ('Connect') is an ambitious endeavor that aims to create a fully-featured social media platform. Built with the MERN stack, this project will make use of MongoDB for data storage, Express.js for server-side routing, React for building the user interface, and Node.js for running the server and handling interactions between the front-end and back-end.

The project will feature user authentication and registration, allowing users to create and manage their own profiles. Users will be able to create and share posts, as well as interact with each other's posts through likes and comments.
